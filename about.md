Who Am I?
===============

My name is Seth, I'm a web developer from Wichita, KS. I've been creating things on the web since I was 13, and I haven't been able or willing to stop ever since.

I've dabbled in quite a few different areas, but have settled on writing code. My strength is in front-end development, but I'm rapidly gaining knowledge about the back-end with focus on Ruby.

Design and UX were also areas of focus for a short span of my time, so my opinion in these areas may arise from time to time on this blog.

Outside of the tech world, I am an active musician and a part-time teacher at Butler Community College in Andover, KS where I lecture on Digital Audio and Web Development.

I have a passion for both music and technology that I love to share with my students. I hope to do the same for my audience here on this site.

But aside from all that this blog is to help me document and track my personal education. Hopefully I can share some of that knowledge along the wasy as well.
