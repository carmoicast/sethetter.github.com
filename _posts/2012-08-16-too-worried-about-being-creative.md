Sometimes I wonder: are we too worried about being original and creative?

As someone who jumps back and forth across the line of designer and developer, I see the creativity that is present in both areas. Although these are two different types of work, the creativity in both comes from the same source.

There's been a lot of discussion about the nature of creativity, and it's something I find myself curious about fairly often. The idea is to be 'creative', we are supposed to have original ideas. That means our ideas are supposed to be unique, as in 'nobody has ever even tried this craziness before.'

But is that really viable?

Just knowing that we are considered professional 'creatives' immediately puts the pressure on us to be creative in such a manner. But in my own situation I've found it's way too easy to get caught up in trying to have original ideas when getting ideas from others who have been successful is really the solution.

## Does every project need a unique approach?

Short answer: __no.__

If we tried to use an entirely unique overall approach to every project we encountered, the vast majority of them would fail, miserably.

Genuinely unique ideas aren't always the most effective. And when you know the success of a certain endeavour is important you can't always risk trying out this new method you've invented.

Coming up with new creative ideas is something you do in smaller off-time projects, where it's okay if it fails horribly. Sure, maybe those ideas can't be fully put to them test until _someone_ tries it in a major production project. But those ideas need to go through levels of testing, and throwing it directly into your newest major investment is probably not the best idea.

## Why am I writing this, anyways?

Let's call it a personal reminder. I put stress on myself to be 'creative' as much as I can. But the fact of the matter is that often times, we just need to find an idea that has worked well for someone else already and take our footing there.

It takes having some sort of grounding of ideas and approaches that you know are successful before you can start dreaming up your own. At least if you want your ideas to be anywhere close to functional, that is.

I'm going to avoid the nicer sounding term of "getting inspiration" and instead encourage you to __copy__ other people's work. If you know it's good work, mimic it, exactly as you see it. Spend time understanding why it's a good idea and what the thought pattern was when it was originally created.

Hunter Thompson used to copy The Great Gatsby from cover to cover over and over again. He did this because F. Scott Fitzgerald was the writer he looked up to, and he wanted to be as good as he was. It helped him develop a sense of rhythm in his writing which eventually became his own.

I believe even when our minds are copying the work of another person we still subconsciously put our own spin on it. We extract the specific qualities of that work that we admire and leave some to go untranslated. In this way, the more you do this the more of a personal style you will develop.

Futhermore, once you know what ideas _are_ successful, take that knowledge of what works and why it works and expand on it. Now you have a foundation for your creativity to play on, and a much better chance of coming up with something awesome.

## Thoughts?

This was a pretty quick and random post, but a self-reminder that was much needed. What do you guys think? Is it a good idea to copy someone's work in order to improve your own? At what point do you stop doing that and try to be all original all the time? If ever?
