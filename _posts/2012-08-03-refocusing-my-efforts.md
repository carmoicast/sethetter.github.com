Things have taken a turn for me lately.

Namely, I've landed a job as a web designer for a local company. While this is very exciting and a much needed improvement to my financial situation, it does present some other issues. For the most part this means I won't have as much time for personal endeavors as I did before.

Some of my recent posts covered an ongoing example project called Daylog, and while I may build on this a bit more in the future, I'm planning to refine my focus a bit so that I'm not covering so many different subject areas.

I'm going to focus more on design and front-end development, and less so on back-end stuff like Rails. While it's not necessarily what I want to do, it's what will be best for me in the long run.

So plan on seeing more articles here covering front end topics. More CSS, more Javascript, and way more design techniques and inspiration.

I've lost a lot of my previous focus on design thanks to my deep-dive into development, both front and back-end. However as a web designer (my new job title) it has become apparent that I need to start putting effort into my design skills again.

Speaking of which, my current design project is going to be to redesign italktoomuch.com. I plan for it to be fully responsive (or at least 'adaptive'). Mobile and tablet compatible layouts are becoming a must in the web industry, so I could always use the practice.

Keep an eye out for a new design, and more posts about design and front end stuff. That is all. :)
