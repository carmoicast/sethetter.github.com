I've been reading a lot on [Zen Habits][1] lately, and one of the most beneficial things has been his talk about 'focus'. Aside from many great articles, he has an ebook available entirely on the subject of focus. In fact, it's called [The Focus Manifesto][2]. There is a free version available, and an extended purchaseable version with much more to offer. This book has taught me quite a few things, one important one in particular:

#### I need to work a new focus ritual.

I know it's going to be difficult to try and set up a schedule and a routine for focusing when I need to, so I think the most valuable thing is to develop the best 'refocus' ritual that I can. I'm obviously going to have to take advantage of my baby's nap times for productivity, so having a refocus ritual to get me back into the zone on demand so I can create is going to be crucial to my process.

I think it should start with a small caffeine boost, I try not to depend on this too much, but it's impossible to deny that it is indeed beneficial. Especially to get myself into 'on demand focus mode'. Whether this is good for you or not is your own decision. For me, it definitely helps. Red bull, coffee, or even those energy shots all work great. However too much at once begins to get counterproductive. It's best for me if I sip on something caffeinated throughout the day, instead of drinking a whole red bull in 30 minutes and having more energy than I know what to do with.

Another important element will be headphones. Not even necessarily with music playing, it can be ambient relaxing sounds. But being able to drown out conflicting sounds will be beneficial to me. I know this from experience. Having some music or sounds playing (heavy or light) will help me to focus on what's in front of me, instead of my mind wandering so much.

Next I should simply sit and write, much like I am now. Writing is a great form of conscious thought for me. It allows me to get into focus the things that are at the forefront of my mind. I can mindfully prioritize the things I know I need and want to accomplish in the coming focus period, and that helps me forget about all the other stuff floating around. Making sure I have other ideas in lists elsewhere also helps to not worry about them.

After all that it's time to focus and create. Whether I'm writing an article, or producing a new application, I should be ready and in the zone for working. Keeping a working list of small steps to take and accomplish during my work period can help to keep me on track. And the number one thing to be mindful of is to not get off task. Remember which one thing you dedicated to working on and stick to it.

The biggest trick is staying conscious of what you're doing. For me this is where the writing is hugely beneficial. If I ever feel myself get off track, I simply stop, open up Evernote (or your preferred text editor) and begin writing about what I should be doing to get my mind back on track. When our minds are capable of juggling a handful of conflicting thoughts all at once it helps a lot to force yourself into a single pointed train of thought; hence writing.

This started as a free writing post to help get this ritual ingrained, but I've decided to publish it. Hell, maybe someone will get some benefiting ideas from it. If so, let me know. I'll feel better about myself :)
