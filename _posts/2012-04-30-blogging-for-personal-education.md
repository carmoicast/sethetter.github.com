title: Blogging for Personal Education
categories: [ personal, blogging ]

I'm starting a new personal commitment. I want to write a new article at least once a week over something I've done recently with a personal project. I'm hoping that this will help me solidify the information in my own mind, and also to pass on what I'm learning to others.

I often find myself not blogging because I know of how many blogs and articles already covered a particular topic, but I'm pushing those feelings aside so that I can write about everything I'm learning regardless. It's important for me to be able to communicate what I pick up in my education, otherwise I'll have to relearn it again and again.

Having a blog with an archive of all the lessons I've learned in development will be hugely beneficial to me. That reference be be invaluable if ever I find myself forgetting something I know I already learned. Instead of having to go through the steps of re-education, I can simply reference my article(s) for that subject, and it should all come crashing back to me.

My hope is that others, too, will be able to benefit from my own personal lessons. I know that this endeavour will prove to be very beneficial to me personally, and if even one other person gets something from my posts, I'll be quite happy. :)
