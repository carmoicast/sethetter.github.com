categories: [ javascript, practice ]
---

Many new web programmers out there (much like myself) have often asked the question of "how do I get better?" The answer is pretty much always simply to *practice*. Of course everything is easier said than done.

Personal projects are a great way to keep yourself working on something, but I personally can say that unless I come up with a great idea that I'm really passionate about, it can be difficult to get motivated to work on a project.

But you don't want to get stuck with no practice while you wait for an idea you're really pumped about, right? I know I don't. I've come across some resources available to help give you some real coding experience and practice with Javascript without having to create your own projects.

# [JS-Assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment) - [Rebecca Murphey](http://rmurphey.com/)

This particular resource is one of the most beneficial I've come across. The JS-Assessment is a list of topics within Javascript that each developer should know and understand well. There is a test file with prewritten assertions that you must make pass in the code. You are given blank function wrappers that you fill in to make the tests go green.

The great thing about JS-Assessment is that it's not any simple fill in the blank type answers. It requires you to programmatically solve each of the outcomes that the tests require. Not only does this make it a bit more challenging, but it gives you experience working with the concepts in Javascript that are going to make you a great developer.

# [Javascript Koans](https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans) - [Liam McLennan](http://hackingon.net/)

Javascript Koans is very similar to the JS-Assessment. There a different 'koans' for many programming languages ([ruby koans](http://rubykoans.com/)), this particular set is for the Javascript language. You are given a set of problems over various topics that have test prewritten for them. You have to correct the code to make the test pass. The main difference here is that there is less code for you to fill in to make each test pass.

One of the awesome things about Javascript Koans is the ability to use the [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io/) plus this project to practice and learn Javacsript [entirely in the cloud](http://blog.bittersweetryan.com/2011/08/learn-some-javascript-completely-on.html)! Seems pretty cool.

# [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski

A new approach to development education (and education in general) is taking a huge turn at this moment in time. Code Academy is a new idea by Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski that gives you the ability to follow course directions in the browser to learn various coding topics. Currently in early stages, the available classes are on [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) and, yes, [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).

Other sites like this exist, but few of matching quality, and few that are equally *free* of charge. The lesson plans are fantastic and even include intermittent projects like creating a blackjack card game using Javascript. For a classroom like format and no cost at all, Code Academy has a lot to offer.

# [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com) - [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com/)

This one is a lot like Code Academy, except the courses available do require you to either buy the course or have an active Code School membership. Now I am not typically one to *want* to pay for services, but for the amount of material and the extremely high quality thereof I could not pass up this great offer.

At $25 a month, the price can seem a little steep, but the benefit here is that you are receiving one full new course each month as well as several Code School TV screencasts along the way. The courses are done in a format involving video lectures followed by exercises (that you actually code) over the topics of the video. You even earn points and badges for progressing through the classes.

This one is not Javascript specific, but it does cover Backbone.js (very hot topic right now), as well as two levels of jQuery. Sometime this month a course over Real-Time Web Apps with Node.js is being released, so keep an eye out for that one as well. The rest of the courses cover topics from Mobile Web Design to Rails Testing and Best Practices. If these are things that interest you, I highly suggest enrolling.

# Did I miss something?

These are a few of the best javascript code practice resources that I've come across, hopefully they are of some help to you. If there was one (or more) that I missed and deserve to be included in the list, let me know in the comments and I will edit accordingly. Thanks as always! :)
