Blogs are all over the internet these days. I can imagine the use of feed readers has grown tremendously over the last few years and it seems to me like they still don't quite handle all the content effectively enough. Thanks to this I have started to embrace newsletters more so than feed readers.

Newsletters let someone else handle handle aggregating relevant and worthwhile articles into one succinct list. Normally I spend half my time glancing over the list in my reader picking out articles of interest. By the time I'm done with all that I've ended up selecting more than I have time to read and most stay unread. Newsletters give me a better focused list (sometimes I can get star happy in Google Reader) that is short enough to read most the articles and still be the most important ones for me to come across.

There's a few newsletters I subscribe to that I would recommend looking in to. First and foremost:

## [Hacker Newsletter][1] ##

This is probably the best discovery I've made online recently. [Hacker News][2] is an excellent source of various news bits that appeal to most hackers out there. It is a news aggregation website that is always changing and sometimes hard to keep up with. But as far as general news goes, nothing beats [HN][2].

Thanks to the [Hacker Newsletter][1] I can stop worrying about keeping an eye on the HN website all the time and instead enjoy a nice weekly digest of the best articles to hit the HN homepage. Anyone looking to free themselves from the repetitive cycle of checking for new articles should definitely [subscribe now][1]. It's just one email a week and its the best one I get.

## [JavaScript Weekly][3] ##

This one is for JavaScript developers (clearly) and is one the best JavaScript resources I've been able to come across. While there are numerous blogs that focus on JavaScript, only a few focus solely on JavaScript. Having a newsletter that collects all the best JS related articles without having to sift through non-JS stuff is incredibly valuable. 

Whether you're interested in front end JS or back end with node, this newsletter is bound to have some great content for you. This newsletter has been a part of my JavaScript digest for some time now and I don't see myself unsubscribing anytime soon. This is another one completely worth checking out.

## [Ruby Weekly][4] ##

Last but not least is [Ruby Weekly][4]. Run by the same Guy as [JavaScript Weekly][3], this is yet another example of a very well put together newsletter. Ruby has blown up in the web dev world thanks to [Ruby on Rails][5] and that means tons of people are writing great articles about it and other Ruby web dev related content.

This newsletter, like the others, gathers the best of all these. Although there is quite a few Rails articles, the newsletter still does a good job of featuring articles relating to other areas of Ruby as well. So if you're not a Rails user, don't worry. There is still plenty of great stuff in the newsletter to catch your interest.
