I've been quickly looking through quite a few different beginner to intermediate level javascript books lately to find one or two that will fit the outline for my upcoming Web Scripting class that I'll be teaching. This search has brought me upon a few of different resources that I definitely need to share with any beginners looking for good books on Javascript. The best thing is that they are all available online free of charge!

### [jQuery Fundamentals - Rebecca Murphey][1] ###

This book starts with a very basic introduction to javascript, followed by a more in-depth coverage of the tools given to us by jQuery. One thing I really like about it is how the javascript introduction covers certain things that most beginner level javascript resources do not. Closures are a good example. They are explained very well here and actually helped seal my understanding of them.

Aside from valuable and relevent content, [Rebecca Murphey][5] has a very casual and easy to follow style of writing. I've always been a fan of her blog and other content, and this is no exception. It's a quick read for anyone interested in refreshing their jQuery skills. It was very beneficial for me, and I will definitely be using this book in my Web Scripting class. I'm sure the students will enjoy _not_ having to pay for it as well :)


### [Eloquent Javascript - Marijn Haverbeke][2] ###

While this book is well known and already renowned in the javascript world, it never hurts to continue giving credit where it's due. While this book does start with a very beginner level introduction to javascript (and a very good one at that) the rest of it's content should be considered intermediate level stuff. Although it wouldn't hurt at all to read through for a beginner as well.

This book is definitely going to be used in my class, maybe not in it's entirety though. Web Scripting is meant to be an intro class to both programming and javascript, so the approach that this book takes it wondeful, but much of it may be beyond the scope of the class.

Regardless, I will be making absolutely sure that my students know about this book before they finish my class. It is a powerful resource for javascript beginners and experts alike. I definitely reccommend taking the time to read through this one.

### [Javascript Design Patterns for Beginners][3] ###

In all honesty, I haven't decided yet if this book will have a place in the Web Scripting class. While it labels itself as a book for 'beginners', Design Patterns themselves might be a little beyond the scope of a programming introduction class. Although I do badly want to include it. Perhaps at least a handful of patterns can be introduced along with the concept of patterns. We will see.

Anyways, this book is awesome. Put together by the great [Addy Osmani][4], so you can be sure that it's nice and readable, with loads of information. Design Patterns can be a tough thing to wrap your head around (at least some specific ones) but Mr. Osmani does a great job of breaking it down to explain how a particular pattern works in Javascript.

While Javascript is different from the purely OOP languages that spawned most of the Design Patterns we use today, it still has implementations of these patterns. This book shows how these patterns are implemented in Javascript, something that isn't always easily translated from the original GoF Design Patterns book. Thankfully we have this great resource available to us so we don't have to worry about it.
