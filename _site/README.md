This is the source code for my personal blogging website hosted here on Github and at italktoomuch.com. It is based on a template directory structure created for [bnjmn.org][2]. Credit is detailed below.

This is a template directory for a [Jekyll][1] site. I created the structure and related scripts when developing my home page, [bnjmn.org][2]. There are remainders from this lying around in the files, typically titles and configurations, however it should be easy for you to make the necesarry modifications. You'll probably want to entirely change the HTML and CSS anyway.
